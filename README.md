# GitHub Search

This is a small ASP.NET MVC project using C# in which you can retrieve a GitHub user by username. This list includes their profile picture, their top repositories based on Github stars and their basic account info.

This project follows a clean architecture taking into consideration SOLID principles and using a service and business layer approach. Unit tests with xUnit have also been implemented to demonstrate my ability and also ensure the solution works as expected, should any further changes be made.

## Improvement & New Features

- Implementing a logger
- JavaScript Framework front-end (React or Vue)
- Adding dependency injection support via Unity
- Additional external Github API support
- Recreate in ASP.NET Core

## Notes

After cloning run "Update-package -reinstall" in Package Manager console to ensure the latest nuget packages are retrieved
